	 Injecting dependencies
	  
	  1. First you are gong to need another POJO to inject into a POJO
	  			-Include a setter for the dependency 
	  				-In the beans view add a property to the POJO with the dependency in it.
	  					-name the new property to match the bean/POJO we are injecting.
	  					-in the ref field type the id of the bean we are referencing. 
	 
	
	 Bean Scope
	  
	  1. in order to change the bean from a singleton you need to change the scope from the beans view 
	  		to prototype
	  
	  
	  
	  Init and Destroy methods
	  
	  1. In the beans view select bean and look for "init-method"
	  			-type the name of the method added to the Person POJO (onCreate)
	  2. In beans view, select bean and look for "destroy-method"
	  			-type the name of the destroy method added to the Person POJO (onDestroy)
	  			- this will ! work if the scope is set to prototype only on singletons
	  			
	  3. You can add a global init-method and/or destroy-method for the beans.xml file 
	  			-select the bean tab from the beans view and there they are!
	  			-naming conventions are the same as the local init and destroy
